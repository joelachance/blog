The latest strategies to waste your time on Medium instead of writing actual f\*%king code

Settle in, weâ€™ve been simplifying this list over the course of years in order to bring you the best, most curated list of super important things youâ€™ll need to do in order to become a good software developer. Donâ€™t worry, if you donâ€™t get through this list, you definitely wonâ€™t get a job. And, if you have a job, your boss is probably going to fire you because he or she knows you never read #6,498. Yep, that one is super important.

#### 1\. Learn ReactÂ already

Unless youâ€™ve been in a coma for the last 5 years, youâ€™ve probably heard of this. This one is super important. If youâ€™re smart enough to actually get past this first step and learn React, youâ€™ll have the privilege of learning node, webpack, babel, jest, enzyme, npm, yarn, styled components, sass, css modules, electron, Typescript, Flow, ES6, ES7, express, ES19, storybook, redux, rollup, #$\*!&â€¦

#### 2\. Donâ€™t Learn Vue or Angular or <any framework exceptÂ React>

Seriously. Why the hell would you not want to learn React? Whatâ€™s the hell is wrong with you?! Canâ€™t you just be a sheep? Facebook wrote the damn thing for crying out loud. Didnâ€™t you read step one?! UUGGGGHHHHH

#### 3\. Learn Webpack!!!

Youâ€™ve probably heard about Parcel. Just ignore what youâ€™ve heard. Itâ€™s just terrible. Parcel doesnâ€™t make your life easier or anything. Just donâ€™t visit [https://parceljs.org/](https://parceljs.org/) and you should still barely be hireable.

#### 4\. Youâ€™re basically worthless until you learn Typescript

This might be the most important one. If your code isnâ€™t strongly typed, just assume every keystroke you make is a bug. Thatâ€™s right, youâ€™re **THAT** bad at development. You might as well just keep drooling on your keyboard instead of writing bug after bug you neanderthal.

#### 5\. Have you started to cryÂ yet?

Good. Youâ€™re never going to make it. Maybe next morning when you wake up, pour yourself a cup of coffee, and start off your morning mildly encouraged, and open up Medium again to read about a bunch of stuff you donâ€™t give a sh\*t about because you really are a sheep. But, you feel like you have to learn all of it because youâ€™re just trying to survive as a developer, and if you donâ€™t know every single tool in existence, youâ€™ll never make it. Let me drop some truth: Your deepest fears are confirmed. Youâ€™re never, ever, going to last as a developer because itâ€™s literally impossible to build a website without using every tool in these lists! Donâ€™t you get it?! Youâ€™ll never MAKE IT! AGGRHGHHBLABLAGBH!.Â â€¦.Â ..Â .Â .Â .

Ok, I think I blacked out there for a moment from trying to help you navigate your way through the very simplistic frontend landscape. Let me clean the drool off of my keyboard and weâ€™ll continue.

#### 6,498. Donâ€™t read these f\*ckingÂ lists.

Let me break the fourth wall here. These lists are, in general, a massive waste of your time. Youâ€™re not going to get an â€˜edgeâ€™ or learn anything more quickly because youâ€™re reading whatâ€™s up â€˜nextâ€™ in Javascript. While a lot of tools do change over time, the main principles of Javascript that existed in the beginning are still around. Thereâ€™s no replacement for just being good with the most important tool you already haveâ€Šâ€”â€Šyour programming language.

If itâ€™s not obvious, the companies that put these lists out are trolling you for your money. Iâ€™ve found so many helpful people in the community that _donâ€™t_ want your money, they just want to see you succeed. _I_ want to see you succeed. If you learn just a little each day, youâ€™ll be successful. And, thereâ€™s no â€˜fast trackâ€™ to learning a language. You have to put in the time & sweat. You _will_ get there.

#### 8,436. Youâ€™re an Excellent Developer.

Congratulations! You made it to the end of this bullsh\*t list! Literally, do not listen to any of the rules here, except maybe _#6,498_. But, up to you. Iâ€™ll leave you with this: You have a responsibility to yourself to do the best you can. Even if youâ€™re stuck on a bug for days, youâ€™re still making progress whether it feels like it or not. Donâ€™t worry about all the noise around youâ€Šâ€”â€Šlearn what youâ€™re passionate about and youâ€™ll do just fine. ðŸ’¯
