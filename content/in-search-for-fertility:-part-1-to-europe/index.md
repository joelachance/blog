_These posts tell our IVF story, how difficult the journey is, and how it took us to Europe and made us stronger._

Maria & I can’t find a moment when we decided ‘going to Europe’ might have been an answer. Looking back, it manifested itself over many months of pain and heartache, the unknown, and obviously, Google searches. We’re from the Twin Cities, and last year we went through IVF at a clinic locally without luck; we got zero good embryos, but still managed to get pregnant, and then miscarry. We had done as much research as possible going into our first IVF experience, but no one tells you how emotionally difficult it is. Doctors don’t typically deliver bad news that well or with much empathy. Western Medicine has its merits, but prioritizing low-stress levels isn’t one.

We started trying to have kids right when we got married. My wife has a daughter from a previous relationship, so while I have the honor of being a dad to a great little girl already, we want a bigger family. About a year after starting to try, I went to get an S.A. (Semen Analysis), and it wasn’t good. All parameters were very low, but on the positive side, I did have _some_ sperm.¹

So, after some preliminary urologists visits, we decided to start looking into IVF clinics.² We found multiple clinics in the Twin Cities and spent a good amount of time comparing prices to their success rates, which tell you how many treatments end in a successful pregnancy. It’s almost impossible to guess your success as there are obviously a lot of factors, which makes choosing a clinic difficult. When in doubt, flip a coin or pick the one with the nicest website 😉

Fast forward 5 months, and we endured a successful egg retrieval, semi-successful embryos (no blastocysts, but close), successful pregnancy, and a successful miscarriage. Specifically, we had an anembryonic pregnancy (this is when the gestational sac grows, but it doesn’t contain a fetus). In this scenario, you either have the option of hoping the body releases the pregnancy tissue on its own, taking medication, or going through a D&C. We ended up choosing all three — we waited 14 weeks, finally took the medication, and when that didn’t work, ended up in the ER overnight for a D&C.

It’s everyone’s inclination, especially in our fast-paced culture, to look at this scenario and say that _something is wrong_. I did something wrong to warrant this outcome. Everyone’s situation is different and infertility could be caused by a trillion different reasons and combinations. We spent a lot of time trying to ‘perfect’ our diet, getting just the right supplement cocktail, getting sleep, and reducing stress. If researching and putting all of that into practice isn’t in itself stressful, I don’t know what is.

We learned several things from our first IVF cycle: our American clinic made our IVF cycle much more complicated than it needed to be and it’s extremely emotional. 

Going to sessions at some of these clinics to learn more seemed to make the process complicated. It’s really not. Looking from a 10,000-foot view, your doctor will prescribe medications throughout your IVF cycle. At least half of these will be injections you’ll need to administer yourself (it’s not as bad as it sounds!). You’ll have between 1–3 injections daily for about  2–4 weeks.³ The last injection you’ll take is a ‘trigger shot’, which will tell your body to release the eggs, and you’ll have your first of two procedures — _egg retrieval_.⁴ After egg retrieval, they’ll combine your eggs with the sperm, and wait 5 days for the embryos to grow.⁵ Your second and last procedure is _egg transfer_, which is a painless, 15-minute procedure, where they put the embryo back inside. Easy.

After your procedures, they’ll continue checking in on progress with ultrasounds. In retrospect, we should have skipped this. When you get pregnant naturally, you’re not at the doctor’s office the next day checking in. This is where most of the stress set in for us. I think the shortcomings of taking a western medicine approach here is that, as I mentioned earlier, doctor’s aren’t equipped to provide the necessary emotional support. That’s how it is. **Just know you need emotional support and don’t go looking for it at your IVF clinic. It’s an additional cost, but a necessary one that we overlooked. Modern medicine is simply amazing in the fact that you can endure severe traumas and not die. Don’t go to your acupuncturist if you broke your arm, for example. Don’t forget health isn’t limited to whether or not you’ve endured severe trauma. Just because you have a hammer doesn’t mean everything is a nail.**

After the D&C, we didn’t immediately jump into the idea that we should try again. Talking to my wife, Maria, Europe was something that we just kept coming back to. We had a very difficult time finding stories about people pursuing IVF internationally, which really made our decision more of a leap of faith.  We didn’t know much about Prague, but as the cost was a fraction of IVF in the States & they had additional sperm-sorting procedures, it seemed like a good idea. This was outside of our comfort zone, but as I’m writing this story from Prague, I can say we’re more stress-free and relaxed than we’ve been in a long time. I’ll admit it’s likely not because we’re in Europe, but because of the path we found along the way⁶.

Before starting our second treatment, we were focused on improving what we had previously done to prepare for our first IVF round. I went through and categorized supplements to make sure I was getting the right ones.⁷ We doubled down on food, getting more strict in certain areas, and more lax in others. Sleep & exercise were important, as was stress.⁸ We also started acupuncture.⁹ I’ll give you a hint: most posts that exist attempting to help you get on track when you’ve had trouble having kids will weight the importance of things incorrectly. Most posts will tell you improving stress is a footnote, and I personally think that reducing stress is 95% of the battle. I realize this is much easier said than done. If you’re worried about picking the right supplement and if you should skip that beer, you’re thinking about this wrong.

So we waited for spring to go to Prague. We decided on IVF Cube and sent over our medical records to start the process. Appointments took place via Skype, and in general, they spoke excellent English. In comparison to the clinic we attended in the States, IVF Cube was definitely a lot more relaxed with appointments and the medication schedule than we experienced previously.¹⁰

**Hiccup #1: Medication**

Dr. Hana (or IVF Cube doctor) sent us a prescription for our meds once we had completed all of the paperwork and were ready to move forward. As we live in the States, we quickly realized no pharmacy is going to fill a prescription from Prague, and no American doctor will re-write it for you. Thankfully we had a good amount of time to prepare, so this wasn’t a major problem. We purchased meds through IVF Pharmacy online, and they came in a week.

**Hiccup #2: Needles**

IVF Pharmacy won’t send you needles internationally. You can probably figure out why customs isn’t cool with sending needles overseas. We were able to hack this hiccup by a visit to my wife’s gynecologist, who we had been working closely with and didn’t have an issue writing us a script for the necessary needles. European sizes were different from the US sizes, so Maria had to tell them the exact size of needles. I can’t guarantee you’ll be as lucky, but you’ll want to work in tandem with your doctor at home to help.

We got lucky with the above problems. Ideally, you just fly to Europe and stay for 3+ weeks and just get meds from the IVF clinic. However, most people don’t have 3+ weeks of free time on their hands. We managed to get incredibly lucky as I work remotely and Maria just took a new job. So, as I sit in Prague writing this, my wife is happily unemployed on the couch reading a book.¹¹

**Hiccup #3: Travel**

**We have needles and meds at this point, however, with our treatment schedule from Prague started at the onset of Maria’s period. We mapped everything out on the calendar the best we could, but it’s impossible to know when a period is going to come. Stress could induce an earlier period or push it back by days. This makes taking time off of work, purchasing flights, & finding lodging difficult. Again luck found us: Maria found flights on Priceline for ~$875 each. As I’m sure you aren’t an expert on airline ticket pricing from the midwest to eastern Europe, that’s a good deal. The catch is you don’t know what airline you’re on, how many connections you’ll have, or the times you’ll fly. A gamble, but again, letting fate take over, we purchased those tickets and so far they’ve worked out perfectly. **

The end of March arrived, Maria spent her last days at her previous job, we dropped our kiddo off with Maria’s family, and we headed to the airport. The flight went smoothly. We jumped in an Uber when we got to Prague and headed to our Airbnb. On the way, we drove right by IVF Cube, which is one office in a concrete cube-shaped building (literally). Our first appointment was at 9:30 (_approximately_) 😏

#### Footnotes

¹ If you don’t have any sperm, you get the privilege of taking a large needle in the testicles to find a couple of stragglers. Luckily all I had to endure was dropping off cups of semen in brown paper bags to a lab, and those are _always_ awkward. Always. A word to the wise, the less conversation you make, the better.

² One word on urologists — all urologists aren’t created equal. [Find one](https://ssmr.org/find-a-doctor.aspx) that knows what he or she is talking about, specifically one that specializes in reproduction. After visiting our second urologist, it was clear our first one didn’t know much on the topic of infertility.

³ My wife preferred I give her the injections, and I enjoyed mixing the medication before the injection.  The purpose of stimulation treatment is to force all of your follicles to produce mature eggs at once. **Our first cycle we had to take birth control and then lupron before starting the stimulation treatment. Our second treatment we didn’t take either of these medications.**

⁴ Our first trigger shot was intra-muscular, meaning it was a large-gauge needle right in the gluteal muscle (your butt).

⁵ Ideally, they will reach the [blastocyst stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastocyst), which is a cellular formation of approximately 200–300 cells following rapid division. At this point, the cells have divided into the ones that will become the gestational sac and the ones that will become the fetus.

⁷ I looked at the top five (well, the five I found were to be legitimate) supplements and listed their ingredients. I then looked at each ingredient and tried to find research backing up any fact that they improve infertility.

⁸ Fast-forward to today — we didn’t follow as strict guidelines we had set up for ourselves for several reasons. The first, we had done 3+ 3-month stints preparing for pregnancy multiple times, and it’s exhausting. There’s no physical feedback that anything you’re doing is working, it’s a little stressful. There’s another, better way, in our opinion.

¹⁰ I found this to be good and bad. It was excellent because we didn’t stress about the details. It’s bad because if this is your first IVF round, you might not know what’s coming next, and disorganization may not help in those scenarios. For example, we were told any month would work fine, and to notify them when we plan on coming. Also, once we arrived and notified them, they told us to show up to the clinic _around_ 9:30, so not a very strict appointment schedule. Overall, I found it a little more difficult to get questions answered as Prague was 6 hours ahead of us and most of the communication was via email, but they did answer all questions we had.

¹¹ Regardless of whether or not you may be religious, I find this good advice. Matthew 6:26: _Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?_
