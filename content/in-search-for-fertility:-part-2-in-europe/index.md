### Arriving in Prague

Getting to Prague was a lot less stressful than I had pictured. I was a little anxious for the flight, not because I didn’t like flying (I love flying), but because of how long of a flight it was (and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX#2019_grounding) had just happened. We were on a 737, but not the Max 8). Though mildly uncomfortable, we arrived in Prague slightly tired and hungry.

I didn’t have to go too far outside of my comfort zone to find transportation to our Airbnb — Uber is a thing in Europe and works just as it does in the States. Maria had data & text, so 10 minutes later we were in our Uber with Pavel.
