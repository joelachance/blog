This is a quick intro into hooks. You can easily switch over, although the React team recommends doing this in phases, [not all at once](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). They arenâ€™t deprecating classes probably ever, so no rush.

Learning about hooks in the 16.8 release ([I was late to this party, apparently](https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/11/react-conf-hooks)) and reading more about it, I was hooked ðŸ˜œ Check it outâ€Šâ€”â€Šwe can replace this:

With Hooks! Here we go:

A deeper, more complete example can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) in the React docs. A couple of call-outs here:

1.  `useState`. This can be declared as many times as youâ€™d like. You donâ€™t need a single declaration in your constructor. The parameter passed to it is your stateâ€™s default value. The above is the same as `state = { counter: 0}`Â .
2.  `useEffect`. Think of this as our lifecycle methods. Again, we can call this method as many times as weâ€™d like inside of our function component. The benefit of this is we can separate concerns this wayâ€Šâ€”â€Šbefore you probably had multiple concerns in each lifecycle method, which gets a little messy (updating state, making a new API call, etc.). The return function of `useEffect` is the same as our `componentDidUnmount` method.
3.  Last, check out our `onClick` function inside of our JSX. You no longer need to call setState to update state. React exposes our state as a method to update. Much simpler and cleaner!

Last noteâ€Šâ€”â€ŠReact hooks help us with code reuse. We no longer need to re-write code in each component that needs to see this counter. We can refactor our stateful logic into other modules to be imported and used later. We could write our `useEffect` like this:

```
import { callAPI } from './api';

const App = () => {

useEffect(callAPI, []); 

// We give useEffect an empty array if we don't return a callback.

...
```

Now, we can test our `callAPI` function, and we have a better, cleaner, more robust codebase. ðŸŽ‰
