Two nights ago I couldn’t sleep. Wide awake. Any responsible adult would probably get up, do some work, workout… I grabbed my phone to browse /r/programming. I’ve noticed a lot of the stories on Hacker News pop up there and as I’m getting closer to finishing Flatiron’s Learn Verified program, I’ve been starting to read articles about interviewing, the state of the tech industry’s job market, and similar posts. One caught my eye, and before reading it, I knew I shouldn’t even open it:

[**F\*\*\* You, I Quit — Hiring Is Broken**

The title alone screams, ‘You don’t want to know about this... Just keep lurking for more posts!’ The following are some of the better, happier ones to cheer up someone still excited about learning to code:

A lot of the posts tend to be negative, from developers who are sick of the way things are. And, can you blame them? We were all promised we could do whatever we wanted growing up, you’re a special snowflake, blah blah. The idealist nature feels good inside. I’ve previously worked in two very large industries, and both have the same plague of, let’s call it… Careeritis: people who were idealists going into their career only to get bashed in by the ‘Flail of Reality’ (you know, the metal ball with spikes). The people who came out of college thinking that they were going to waltz into Google and supermodels were going to throw money in their face for their exquisite and eloquent understanding of Object Oriented Architecture, when in reality… I was a victim of that throughout my music career, and it’s completely toxic.

Back to the ‘F\*\*k you, I quit’ post. I read this, at about 4am, and doubt set in. ‘If this guy who just complained for 19 straight reading minutes on Medium who has a 960+ day Github streak can’t find a job, how can I?’, or ‘I don’t know what the hell a ‘binary tree’ is and I sure as hell don’t know what a ‘breadth-first search’ is either, and how can Learn promise me a job?’ I’ve more recently read some follow-up blogs responding to this one, such as this one:

This describes a hiring situation where…_no one is wrong_. The consensus seems to be that the hiring process does ‘in fact’ suck, but how do you change it? You don’t put up with the bullshit. And maybe that’s wishful thinking considering I haven’t held a single job as a developer yet, but I don’t think that’s wrong. I’ve worked several places because the money was good, or they were offering to give me money, or I needed money…you get the idea. The truth is for me, is the older I become the more my life matters, and the less I’m willing to submit myself to a shitty job where I’m waiting for 5 o’clock to hit (I’ve had two jobs like this, and I wouldn’t wish this upon my worst enemy). Which brings me to this: if you know exactly what you want to spend your time doing, then why aren’t you doing it right now?

I remember getting to use a computer for the first time in grade school (Do NOT pull Oregon Trail out of the drive if the red light is on, you’ll literally blow the computer up! — My teacher, verbatim), or figuring out a DOS prompt when my parents got our first computer (a kitchen-sink-sized IBM, with probably 5KB of memory), or when I scored a ‘D’ in a college Java course (another post for another day). The bottom line is, I still love doing this. I’m not getting paid a red cent right now, and I’m excited to get out of bed everyday and work on a new project, even when I’m hopelessly stuck. I worried when I was younger that I would grow out of stuff that fascinated me. But the truth is, I still love music. I still want to be an astronaut. I even still like dinosaurs. The older I get, the more I understand your inner youthful-ness never leaves, you’re just able to sort through the bullshit a lot better and see things for what they are.
